 * Bound to '*', so `$siteName` is available in storefront, dashboard, admin,
 * auth and mail views alike. The read goes through SiteSetting::get, which is
 * already cache-backed and busted by SiteSetting::put - so no extra memo here:
 * a per-process cache would otherwise serve a stale name to long-running queue
 * workers until they restarted.
