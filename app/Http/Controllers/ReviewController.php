 * Customer-submitted reviews. A shopper leaves a star rating + review; it is
 * stored unpublished + flagged as a customer submission so an admin approves it
 * before it appears on the storefront.
 *
 * Signed-in customers review under their own account name (so the review ties
 * back to them - verified badge + one-per-account dedup), and can attribute it
 * to a delivered order (via `order_id`) so its rating rolls up under every gift
 * card they bought. Guests review with a name they supply; their submission has
 * no account and no dedup, so admin moderation is the spam gate.
